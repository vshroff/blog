I am a keen and inquisitive learner, currently pursuing MS Applied Data Science Student at University of Southern California. 

After completing my undergrduate degree in Computer Science with Cum Laude, I was selected to work with Elsevier Inc. as a software engineer where I worked on developing applications for medical professionals and students.
