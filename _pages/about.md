I was born and raised in Delhi, India and always strove for academic excellence throughout my school years. Then I emigrated to the U.S. with my family in 2017 where I completed my **B.S. degree in Computer Science** at California State University - East Bay. I focused on courses such as AI and software engineering, which I found so engrossing that I loaded up on credits, enabling me to graduate **Cum Laude in three years.** I also worked part-time as a tutor, supplemental instructor, and student researcher. Selected for a **National Science Foundation (NSF)** funded internship at **Iowa State University**, I worked on reducing disorientation while **teleporting in VR**. I was also a **Distinguished Pioneer Scholar** at the Center of Student Research at my university, where I designed and presented an **educational VR game** at the **Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE) Conference held in Phoenix, Arizona**.

Upon graduation, I accepted an offer to work as a full stack **Software Engineer with Elsevier**, a global information and analytics company. While developing software for eLearning web applications, I became curious about other functions in the organization. I was thrilled by Research Intelligence tools providing insightful analyses to researchers and AI-enabled R&D solutions providing faster return on investments through **data science and analysis**.

This started my quest to understand the field of data science at a deeper level and I explored the subject through discussions with my colleagues, participation in hack days/innovation days and through my own research. I was intrigued by how data impacts every aspect of our lives, and how important it is to research methods to effectively utilize this data.

My love for Data and primary aim in life to pursue higher education, led me to study **MS Applied Data Science at University of Southern California**.
